# Garden-World-Personal-Project
My name is David Micah-Daniels, I am a 15 years old programmer and web developer, i developed GARDEN WORLD in roughly 1+ week, it was a very cool experience while i developed this project because i put in my best and developed it with all the skills i can, the website was developed to aid subsistent/small scale gardeners (only), it provdes them with details about garden, garden products and even links to where the user can purchase such product, the website has a lot of functonalities: product purchase/redirections, mail app toggler, call directly from webste, product suggestons, blog, google map API, book purchase/reirection. this is just one of my many other projects.
